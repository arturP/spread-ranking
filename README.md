# Spread Ranking Microservice

A Java Spring Boot microservice that creates cryptocurrency market rankings based on current spread percentages using Kanga Exchange API.

### Spread Calculation Formula
```
Spread = (ASK - BID) / [0.5 * (ASK + BID)] * 100%
```

### Market Groups
- **Group 1**: Spread â‰¤ 2%
- **Group 2**: Spread > 2%
- **Group 3**: Cannot calculate spread (missing BID/ASK prices)
